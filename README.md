# AWS Credential Helper

This is a small tool (toy?) for me and my colleagues to ease up the task of having to frequently update various profiles in our `~/.aws/credential` files. This tool lives in your systray

![systray](doc/systray.png)

 and watches your clipboard for AWS credentials in the form of

```plain
[default]
aws_access_key_id=bla
aws_secret_access_key=foo
aws_session_token=bar
```

and pops up a dialog like this:

It will be pre-populated with buttons of your existing profiles, so you can update a profile with one click. And that's it, no bells or whistles of any kind ðŸ˜‰.

While this has been created with the excellent [Qt Framework & Development Tools](https://www.qt.io) and is cross-platform, it is specifically targeted at Windows.
